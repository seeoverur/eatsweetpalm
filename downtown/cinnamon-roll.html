            <h2 class="mb-4">Baked with Lowcountry Love</h2>
            <p>There is a specific kind of magic that happens in the early hours of the morning at <strong>Sweet Palm Coffee</strong>. Before the sun fully climbs over the Ravenel Bridge and the streets of downtown Charleston hum with their usual energy, our kitchen is alive with the scent of yeast, butter, and premium Saigon cinnamon. We don’t believe in rushing the process. We believe in the slow rise, the patient fold of the dough, and the perfect golden-brown finish that only comes from small-batch baking.</p>

            <p>Our signature cinnamon rolls aren't your typical coffee shop pastry. They are a labor of love, designed to be the perfect companion to our locally roasted brews. We start with a brioche-style dough that is rich, pillowy, and just sturdy enough to hold the generous layers of cinnamon-sugar swirl. Each roll is hand-cut and nestled into the pan, ensuring that every bite—from the crispy outer edge to the legendary "gooey center"—is consistent and soul-warming.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Secret is in the Sizzle (and the Frosting)</h3>
            <p>What sets a Sweet Palm Cinnamon Roll apart? It’s the balance. We know that many rolls out there are simply too sweet, masking the flavor of the dough. We’ve perfected a cream cheese frosting that is velvety and tangy, applied while the rolls are still whispering-hot from the oven. This allows the icing to melt slightly into the spirals, creating a moisture-rich experience that stays delicious down to the last crumb.</p>

            <p>Whether you are a local heading to work or a visitor exploring the historic charm of downtown, stopping by Sweet Palm is about more than just a quick snack. It’s about taking a moment to breathe. It’s about the steam rising from your latte and the first pull-apart section of a warm roll. It’s the feeling of home, right in the heart of Charleston.</p>
